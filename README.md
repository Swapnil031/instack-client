# InStack
### Instagram Website Clone

**[Live Site - Signup and Enjoy!](https://swapnil031.github.io/instack-client/)**

This is the code repository for the project "InStack" - the website clone of Instagram, a popular social media site.
Signup in the app and enjoy the site! Users can post pictures, like and comment on other posts, follow/unfollow other users and edit their profile. 

The website is developed using MERN stack - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Here, I have used [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) for designing the interactive and mobile-responsive frontend of app. 

The server is hosted on **Heroku** and the frontend is deployed on **Github-Pages**.

**Concepts learnt :**
* REST APIs, CRUD operations
* Json Web Token(jwt), bcrypt.js for user authentication
* React Hooks (useContext, useReducer), Express Middlewares
* MERN Stack - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
