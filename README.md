# InStack
### An Instagram Website Clone

**[Live Site - Signup and Enjoy!](https://swapnil031.github.io/instack-client/)**

This is the code repository for the project "InStack" - the website clone of Instagram, a popular social media site.
Signup in the app and enjoy the site! Users can post pictures, like and comment on other posts, follow/unfollow other users and edit their profile. 

The website is developed using MERN stack -
MongoDB - NoSQL based DBMS
Express - A node.js framework
React - A JS library
Node.js - A JS runtime envt.

Here I have used Materialize - CSS framework - for designing an interactive and mobile-responsive frontend of app. 
//The frontend of the app is designed mobile-responsive using **CSS** and developed in **React**. The client-side is deployed on **Github-Pages**.

The backend server is hosted on **Heroku** and the frontend of app is deployed on **Github-Pages**.

Concepts learnt :
* RESTful APIs - setting up communication b/w client and server
* Json Web Token(jwt) - user authentication
* Express Middlewares - creating protected routes
* React Hooks - useContext, useReducer, useState, useEffect
* MERN Stack - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
